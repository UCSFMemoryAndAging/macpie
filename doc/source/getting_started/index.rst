Installation
------------

All you need to install MACPie is a Python environment. If
you do not have Python installed or are not sure, the easiest way to proceed is to
install Anaconda, a popular cross platform distribution of Python.


Easy way
~~~~~~~~
The easiest way to install MACPie is using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install macpie

To install all the extra dependencies, including all command line tools:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install macpie[all]
