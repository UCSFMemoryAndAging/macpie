CLI Reference
=============

Installing MACPie also installs a number of command line tools. The main command line tool
is also called ``macpie``, and it provides commands that you can use to analyze data contained
in Excel and/or CSV/text files. All commands should be executed inside your activated
virtual environment (or conda environment) that you created in the :ref:`installation` section.
The ``--help`` option will give more information about any commands and options.
