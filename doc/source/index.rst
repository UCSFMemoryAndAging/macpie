Welcome to MACPie's documentation. Get started by :doc:`installing <getting_started/install>` `macpie`

Description
-----------

MACPie is an open source Python library and set of command line tools designed for
clinical research. The library provides useful data structures and utilities to
represent, analyze, and process typical clinical research data. The main command line
tool provides access to the power of the library through commands you type in at your
terminal or console, allowing you to work with data contained in your local Excel/CSV files.

MACPie was created at the `UCSF Memory and Aging Center <https://memory.ucsf.edu/>`_, 
a dynamic multidisciplinary clinical research program investigating neurodegenerative diseases.
