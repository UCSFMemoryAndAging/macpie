Welcome to MACPie
=================

Welcome to MACPie's documentation. Get started by :doc:`installing <getting_started/install>` `macpie`
and then start using its :doc:`command line interface <getting_started/cli>`.


Description
-----------

MACPie is an open source Python library and set of command line tools designed
for clinical research. The library provides useful data structures and utilities
to represent, clean, analyze, and process typical clinical research data. The
main command line tool provides access to the power of the library through
commands you type in at your terminal or console, allowing you to easily work with
data contained in your local Excel/CSV files.

MACPie was created at the `UCSF Memory and Aging Center <https://memory.ucsf.edu/>`_, 
a dynamic multidisciplinary clinical research program investigating neurodegenerative diseases.
