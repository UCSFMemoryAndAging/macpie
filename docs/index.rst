Welcome to MACPie
=================

Welcome to MACPie's documentation. Get started with :doc:`installation`
and then start using the command line interface with :doc:`cli`.

MACPie is an open source Python library and command line tool designed for clinical research.
The library provides useful data structures to represent typical clinical research data,
and powerful functions to analyze, query, and link such data.
The command line tool provides access to the power of the library through commands 
you type in at your terminal or console, allowing you to analyze or link data contained in 
your local Excel/CSV files.

MACPie was created at the `UCSF Memory and Aging Center <https://memory.ucsf.edu/>`_, 
a dynamic multidisciplinary clinical research program investigating neurodegenerative diseases.
